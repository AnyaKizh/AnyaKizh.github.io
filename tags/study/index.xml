      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;general-information-about-the-week&#34;&gt;General Information About the Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, my days were filled with interesting events and discoveries. I followed my usual schedule for half of the week, but starting from May 8th, due to Victory Day, the days from the 8th to the 11th were holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;events&#34;&gt;Events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week, I not only had a good rest but also worked productively, because next week I will have tests and quizzes, so I needed to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation-for-next-week&#34;&gt;Preparation for Next Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to prepare for quizzes in mathematical analysis and linear algebra, as well as for a test in mathematical logic, so I studied diligently all week. In the first few days, I reviewed all the necessary topics in mathematical logic, then completed the homework for linear algebra to better understand the subject. I finished my preparation with mathematical analysis and getting ready for the quiz on integrals.&lt;/p&gt;
